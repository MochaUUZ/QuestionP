                "text": "The most obvious manifestations of earthquakes are earthquake fault offset, liquefaction, landslides, and ground shaking. Each of these hazards can be mitigated through careful site planning.\n\nLiquefaction occurs when water-saturated soils, sands, or gravels flow laterally or vertically like a liquid. This occurs when earthquake ground motions shake the material until the water pressure increases to the point that friction between particles is lost, and the ground flows, losing its strength. Liquefaction is most likely to occur where the soils are not consolidated (near rivers and streams, in basins, near coastlines and in areas of unconsolidated alluvium) and where ground water is within three to four meters of the surface. Liquefaction can occur at greater depths, resulting in large-scale ground failure that can destroy pavement, underground utilities, and building foundations.\n\nLandslides, ground settlement, and avalanches occur widely with and without earthquakes as a cause. All require special architectural treatment. Landslides and avalanches occur on slopes of a variety of geological materials.\n\nPotential for ground failure and landslides is determined by soil type, water content (degree of saturation), gradient (slope angle) and triggering events (an earthquake, excavation that upsets the site equilibrium, increase in water content resulting from irrigation or storm run-off). Geotechnical investigations of the site and surrounding terrain are critical in determining site vulnerability.\n\nA tsunami is a rapid rise in coastal sea level caused by offshore earthquakes that displace the ocean bottom, earthquake-triggered or natural submarine landslides and slumps, volcanic eruptions, or very infrequently by meteor strikes. Tsunami waves have a very long wavelength and travel at approximately 500 miles per hour in the open ocean. As they approach shallow waters, their speed and wavelength decreases, and their height increases dramatically."
